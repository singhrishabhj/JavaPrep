// Topic: Count Occurrences of a Specific Element in an Array

// Question:
// Given an array of integers, count the number of occurrences of a specific element in the array.
// Write a method to find how many times the element appears in the array.

// Problem Explanation:
// You are given an array of integers and a target element. Your task is to count how many times the target element appears in the array.
// You can iterate through the array and compare each element to the target element, increasing a counter whenever a match is found.

// Approach:
// 1. Initialize a counter variable to zero.
// 2. Iterate through the array and compare each element with the target element.
// 3. If a match is found, increment the counter.
// 4. Return the counter after the loop completes.

// Solution:
