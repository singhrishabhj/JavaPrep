# Java Coding Challenge: Countdown to Lift-off

## Problem Statement
Alright, Space Explorer! You've seen how our simple Java program works. Now, let's see if you can recreate it from scratch. Your mission is to start the countdown for the launch of our virtual spacecraft. Remember, every Java program starts with a class and a main method. I've left you some breadcrumbs to guide your way.

## Objective
Write a Java program that prints the countdown message:
```
3, 2, 1... Lift off!
```
to the console.

---

## Code to Complete
```java
// TODO: Declare a class named 'Solution' (other class names won't work)
// Make sure NOT to make your class 'public'

    // TODO: Inside your class, define the main 'public static void main' method that Java looks for

        // TODO: Use a print statement to display a message "3, 2, 1... Lift off!" to the console
```

---

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Printing the countdown message
        System.out.println("3, 2, 1... Lift off!");
    }
}
```

---

## Explanation
- The `class Solution` declaration creates a class named `Solution`.
- The `main` method serves as the entry point of the Java program.
- `System.out.println("3, 2, 1... Lift off!")` prints the countdown message to the console.
- The program follows Java's syntax rules for defining classes and methods.

### Key Takeaways
- Every Java program must have a `main` method inside a class.
- `System.out.println()` is used to print output to the console.
- Writing simple programs from scratch reinforces Java fundamentals.

Try writing the program yourself before looking at the solution!
