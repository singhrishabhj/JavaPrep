# Java Coding Challenge: Send a Message to the Java Universe

## Problem Statement
Brace yourself for launch, Space Voyager! It's time to send your very first message to the Java universe. Complete the code to broadcast your greeting across the cosmos!

## Objective
Write a Java program that prints a welcome message for new space explorers learning Java.

---

## Code to Complete
```java
class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO: Print a welcome message for new space explorers learning Java.
    }
}
```

---

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Printing a welcome message for new space explorers
        System.out.println("Welcome to the Java universe, Space Voyager!");
    }
}
```

---

## Explanation
- The `System.out.println(...)` method is used to print the message to the console.
- The message `"Welcome to the Java universe, Space Voyager!"` is enclosed in double quotes.
- This simple program helps new learners get familiar with Java's output statement.

### Key Takeaways
- `System.out.println()` is the primary way to display output in Java.
- Strings in Java must be enclosed in double quotes.
- Writing and running simple programs builds confidence in coding.

Try modifying the message and experimenting with different outputs!
