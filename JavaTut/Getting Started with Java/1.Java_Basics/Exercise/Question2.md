# Java Coding Challenge: Greetings from the Stars

## Problem Statement
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to update the greeting message in the Java program for a taste of editing code. Change the text within `System.out.println` to `"Journey to the stars begins with Java!"` to celebrate the start of your coding adventure.

## Objective
Write a Java program that prints the message:
```
Journey to the stars begins with Java!
```
to the console.

---

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This line prints a message about space exploration
        System.out.println("Journey to the stars begins with Java!");
    }
}
```

---

## Explanation
- The `main` method serves as the entry point of the Java program.
- `System.out.println(...)` prints the given message to the console.
- The text inside the quotes is displayed exactly as it is.
- This simple program demonstrates basic output in Java.

### Key Takeaways
- `System.out.println()` is used for printing in Java.
- The `main` method is essential for execution.
- Double quotes (`""`) enclose strings in Java.

Try modifying the message and run it again.
