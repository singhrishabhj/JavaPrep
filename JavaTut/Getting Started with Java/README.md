## Folder Structure

### **1. Java_Basics** 
Covers fundamental Java concepts, including syntax, comments, semicolons, and writing your first Java program.

### **2. Java_Variables** 
Learn about variables in Java, including how to declare, initialize, and use them for storing data.

### **3. Java_Primitive_Strings** 
Explore primitive data types and strings in Java. This will help you understand how Java handles different types of data.

### **4. Java_Comparisons** 
Dive into Java comparison operators, which are essential for controlling the flow of your program by comparing values.

### **5. Java_Arithmetic_Logical_Operations** 
Master arithmetic and logical operations on primitive types, crucial for data manipulation and decision-making in Java programs.

### **6. Java_TypeConversion** 
Understand primitive data type conversion in Java, including both automatic and explicit type conversions.

### **7. Java_DecisionMaking** 
Learn about conditional statements such as if-else, switch case, and the ternary operator, which influence a program's flow.

### **8. Java_Loops** 
Discover loops in Java, including `for`, `while`, and `do-while`, which allow repeated execution of code blocks.

### **9. Java_String_Concat** 
Explore string concatenation in Java using `+`, `concat()`, and `StringBuilder` for efficient text manipulation.
