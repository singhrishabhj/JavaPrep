# Developing a Shape Library for Geometry Calculations

## Part - 1

We need to create a library to represent shapes and their properties. The library should be able to calculate:
- Total number of corners
- Total area

**Learning :**

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Dynamic and Extensible
- Modular Programming

## Part - 2

In this part, we'll enhance the shape library to include color functionality without modifying the existing classes and interfaces. The new feature will adjust the area of each shape based on its color:

- RED: Doubles the shape's area.
- GREEN: Keeps the shape's area unchanged.
- BLUE: Halves the shape's area.
