1.07 (Population projection) 
  The U.S. Census Bureau projects population based on the following assumptions:
  ■ One birth every 7 seconds
  ■ One death every 13 seconds
  ■ One new immigrant every 45 seconds
  Write a program to display the population for each of the next five years. Assume the current population is 312,032,486 and one year has 365 days. Hint: In Java, if two integers perform division, the result is an integer. The fraction part is truncated. For example, 5 / 4 is 1 (not 1.25) and 10 / 4 is 2 (not 2.5).
